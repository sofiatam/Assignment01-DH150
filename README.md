#### Community I want to contribute to with my UX design
Through my UX design, I hope to impact the food community by providing foodies (+ aspring foodies) with a seamless and efficient experience on Yelp (website and app).

#### Web/App I chose for my project
**URL:** https://yelp.com

**Screenshot of website:** 

**Screenshot of app:** 

**Brief info about site:** Yelp is a popular platform for customers to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.).

**Overall evaluation:** Yelp is a practical website that is relatively easy to navigate. However, Yelp still exhibits many instances of poor user interface that hinder the user's overall experience.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
##### 1. Visibility of system status
**2:** Yelp does not display information on whether a company is still in business or not without the user clicking the particular business, which is inefficient and frustrating for the user. Additionally, Yelp does not indicate whether a business is closing soon, nor does it make a businesses' hours readily visible. However, Yelp does a good job of indicating when the application is loading and processing the user's requests. There is no indication of loading status, though (like % complete, for example).

##### 2. Match between system and real world
**1:** Yelp does a great job of connecting with the user by using jargon that is simple to comprehend and commonly used by its userbase. Since the website is heavily dependent on user contribution, the reviews are not filled with overcomplicated words and is created specially for other Yelp users. The terminology used must be easily digestible by the everyday Yelp user.

##### 3. User control and freedom
**2:** Yelp does not have an undo feature in its search feature. Yelp also lacks a "clear" option for its search filters. It is not clear how to undo filters that were chosen by mistake. Refining choices in general could use more improvement. Yelp does a good job of allowing users to search by a map, which gives the user more freedom in their searches. Again, though, there is no way to undo the map if the user accidentally zooms away/too far from their point of interest.

##### 4. Consistency and standards
**1:** Yelp is very consistent with how it defines its features and labels. This way, it is easy for users to navigate through different parts of the site. I think Yelp does an exceptional job of keeping its terminology consistent throughout. Yelp also offers auto-fill suggestions if the user is unsure if the phrase means the same thing as what Yelp recognizes. Yelp also utilizes the same symbols for respective features throughout the site to maintain visual consistency.

##### 5. Error prevention


##### 6. Recognition rather than recall


##### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use


##### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design


##### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors


##### 10. Help and documentation
