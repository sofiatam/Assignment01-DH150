#### Community I want to contribute to with my UX design
Through my UX design, I hope to impact the food community by providing foodies (+ aspring foodies) with a seamless and efficient experience on Yelp (website and app).

#### Web/App I chose for my project
URL: https://yelp.com

Brief info about site: Yelp is a popular platform for customers to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.).

Overall evaluation: Yelp is a practical website that is relatively easy to navigate. However, Yelp still exhibits many instances of poor user interface that hinder the user's overall experience.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
1. Visibility of system status

2. Match between system and real world

3. User control and freedom

4. Consistency and standards

5. Error prevention

6. Recognition rather than recall

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

10. Help and documentation
