**Brief info about sites:** Yelp is a popular platform for customers to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.). Yelp has a social component that allows people to see other's reviews, curated collections, and recommended businesses. OpenTable, which is a part of Booking.com, only operates in the food space. OpenTable provides a similar service to Yelp in that it allows for searching of restaurants, booking of reservations, and writing of reviews. The primary feature of OpenTable is to make reservations.

------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------
1 | 2


-----------------------------------
**1. Visibility of system status**
#### Yelp
> **3:** Yelp does not display information on whether a company is still in business or not without the user clicking the particular business, which is inefficient and frustrating for the user. Additionally, Yelp does not indicate whether a business is closing soon, nor does it make a businesses' hours readily visible. However, Yelp does a good job of indicating when the application is loading and processing the user's requests. There is no indication of loading status, though (like % complete, for example). Yelp should focus on displaying more relevant information, like on the status of its businesses and loading progress, for example.
#### OpenTable
> **2:** Unlike Yelp, OpenTable filters by time, so OpenTable only displays restaurants that are open (and in business) near or around that time. Like Yelp, OpenTable also does not indicate loading status when loading search results. OpenTable also does a good job of indicating which time slots are unavailable for reservations by coloring those blocks in gray, and leaving open reservations in red.

-----------------------------------
**2. Match between system and real world**
#### Yelp
> **1:** Yelp does a great job of connecting with the user by using jargon that is simple to comprehend and commonly used by its userbase. Since Yelp is heavily dependent on user contribution, the reviews are not filled with overcomplicated words and is created specially for other Yelp users. The terminology used must be easily digestible by the everyday Yelp user.
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable does a really good job of using terminology that is easy to understand by its users. The website uses words like "you" to establish a better connection with the user by making it seem like it is the user's own, personal experience. The words used throughout OpenTable help simplify the process and help its users get from A to B.

-----------------------------------
**3. User control and freedom**
#### Yelp
> **2:** Yelp does not have an undo feature in its search feature. Yelp also lacks a "clear" option for its search filters. It is not clear how to undo filters that were chosen by mistake. Refining choices in general could use more improvement. Yelp does a good job of allowing users to search by a map, which gives the user more freedom in their searches. Again, though, there is no way to undo the map if the user accidentally zooms away/too far from their point of interest.
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable only allows users to filter their search results, and selected filters show up at the top of the search results. These filters are clearly marked and easy to clear by an X (press the X to clear the filter, intuitive). OpenTable also only allows for many different searches to be made, which can vary from time, date, and number of people. The user is able to select the location they would like to search.

-----------------------------------
**4. Consistency and standards**
#### Yelp
> **2:** Yelp is very consistent with how it defines its features and labels. This way, it is easy for users to navigate through different parts of the site. I think Yelp does an exceptional job of keeping its terminology consistent throughout. Yelp also offers auto-fill suggestions if the user is unsure if the phrase means the same thing as what Yelp recognizes. Yelp also utilizes the same symbols for respective features throughout the site to maintain visual consistency. The website and app seem to prioritize different features, though. The website seems to prioritize the social aspect of Yelp with the "Recent Activity" on the splash page, while the mobile does not provide easy access to "Recent Activity." Instead, the mobile app provides an entire section for "Deliveries," which is not emphasized at all on the website.
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable is also very consistent with its features. Between the website and mobile app, the capabilities are almost identical and pose no extra learning curve for users. OpenTable does a great job of using common terminology that a user would recognize. There is visual consistency between the entire scope of OpenTable (website, app). Both platforms seem to accomplish the main goal of making a reservation for a restaurant.

-----------------------------------
**5. Error prevention**
#### Yelp
> **1:** Yelp displays error pop-up messages when appropriate. One example of an error is if the user tries to search by "Current Location" but Yelp does not have access to the user's location. This prompts a pop-up that tells the user that the app does not have access to their location. Another good error prevention mechanism Yelp has is if the user makes a typo in the searh bar, Yelp will override the user's search entry and display results for what they think the user meant to type. There is still a "search instead for \_\_:" option if the user did actually mean to search what they typed. Yelp also prompts for confirmation in several instances, like if the user tries to delete a drafted review. 
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable prevents users from making erroneous entries when creating a search query by permitting dropdown menus for number of guests and time. The calendar also does not allow the user to select invalid dates. Lastly, the location bar also recommends cities and restaurants by attempting to guess what the user is trying to type. In the rare instance that a search entry is invalid (location is not found, for example), OpenTable prompts the user to either undo their actions or start their search over. However, when erroneously making a reservation, there is no undo or back button to leave the reservation screen. When closing the tab, OpenTable does have a pop-up for me to confirm my exit.

-----------------------------------
**6. Recognition rather than recall**
#### Yelp
> **1:** Yelp displays recently viewed businesses to its users, which makes it easy for users to remember what businesses they were just looking at. Yelp also utilizes icons that make logical sense so that users do not need to always depend on reading the section headers but rather rely on imagery. The five-star rating system with different coloring and fill based on reviews is also easy for users to comprehend and interpret.
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable also displays recently viewed businesses to its users, so users can recall what restaurants they were just looking at. OpenTable relies on imagery and a certain color scheme throughout, so that the site is consistent. For example, the red color used in OpenTable is used for selection of a restaurant, available reservation times, and buttons. These features all have positive connotations. The ratings of restaurants are also indicated in red stars in the five-star rating format, like Yelp.

-----------------------------------
**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**
#### Yelp
> **2:** Yelp is not that flexible in its search capabilities. Yelp does not allow search in multiple cities unless the user toggles the map. This means the user has to start many new searches to accomplish a simple goal of finding a partiular business. The feature toggling is useful, though, because it gives users more flexibility over the results they are presented. Another issue is that it is not intuitive for how to edit a collection (ex: delete an extraneous entry).
#### OpenTable
> **2:** OpenTable does not allow for that much flexibility in its search queries. OpenTable only permits options from dropdown menus for time, for example. The user can only choose a time in 30 minute blocks. OpenTable also does not allow for search in multiple cities. The filters allow for a lot of flexibility and refining of search results.

-----------------------------------
**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**
#### Yelp
> **2:** Yelp recently underwent a redesign where it embraced a more minimalist design. There are less distracting lines and blocks, which make accessing relevant information easier and more efficient. Search results still display sample reviews, however, which I think is too many words for the user to comprehend, so I hypothesize that the user does not even read the sample review displayed on the search landing page. There are also too many advertisements, in my opinion.
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable's design is incredibly clean and minimalist. This design makes the usability very easy and simple to follow. Minimal information is presented for each restaurant result, which keeps the search results clean and less text-heavy. Only price, type of establishment, rating, and available reservations are displayed. OpenTable relies on symbols instead of text to get the message across to its users. 

-----------------------------------
**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
#### Yelp
> **1:** Yelp displays constructive error messages for the user when they make an error. For example, when the user's location is not accessible, Yelp provides useful instructions for how the user can overcome this issue. Yelp also provides alternative search results if it is unable to comprehend what the user is trying to access. For example, if the user enters a location that Yelp does not recognize, it provides dozens of other locations that the user that might be useful to the user instead. Also, if a user is trying to find a particular business, Yelp will provide similar results for the user.
#### OpenTable
> **1:** OpenTable develops a relationship with its users by using terms in the second-person ("you," "your," etc.). After establishing this connection with the user, when the user makes an error, OpenTable suggests methods of fixing their error(s) and gently prompts the user to try again. OpenTable describes in simple terms what error was made and how to remedy this error so that the user is aware for next time.

-----------------------------------
**10. Help and documentation**
#### Yelp
> **3:** Yelp does not have an easily accessible "Help" or "FAQs" section. Only when the user makes an explicit error are they able to find concrete steps on how to correct the issue at hand. Although the site is relatively easy to navigate, it is very difficult to find help if the user needs it. At the very bottom of Yelp's website, there is a "Support" hyperlink that directs users to their "Support Center." This section is difficult to locate, and I could not even find it upon first look. On the mobile app, however, it is significantly easier to find the "Support Center."
#### OpenTable
> **2:** OpenTable's website has a "Help" section that is easy to locate, as it is at the top right corner of the landing page. On the app, however, it was more difficult to find a "Help" section. The "Help" section was located in "Account Settings," which is not that intuitive to me. It is easy for users to navigate OpenTable, so I doubt users will need to continuously access the "Help" files.


-----------------------------------
**Overall evaluation:** Yelp is a practical website that is relatively easy to navigate. Users are logically able to follow A to B to reach their end goal, amidst the usability errors described above. Yelp still exhibits many instances of poor user interface that hinder the user's overall experience. OpenTable, on the otherhand, is incredibly easy to use. OpenTable has great usability and is incredibly easy for new users to grasp. There are only a few instances of poor user interface on OpenTable.
