#### Community I want to contribute to with my UX design
Through my UX design, I hope to impact the food community by providing foodies (+ aspring foodies) with a seamless and efficient experience on Yelp (website and app).

#### Web/App I chose for my project
**URL:** https://yelp.com

**Screenshot of website:** 

**Screenshot of app:** 

**Brief info about site:** Yelp is a popular platform for customers to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.).

**Overall evaluation:** Yelp is a practical website that is relatively easy to navigate. However, Yelp still exhibits many instances of poor user interface that hinder the user's overall experience.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
**1. Visibility of system status**
> **3:** Yelp does not display information on whether a company is still in business or not without the user clicking the particular business, which is inefficient and frustrating for the user. Additionally, Yelp does not indicate whether a business is closing soon, nor does it make a businesses' hours readily visible. However, Yelp does a good job of indicating when the application is loading and processing the user's requests. There is no indication of loading status, though (like % complete, for example). Yelp should focus on displaying more relevant information, like on the status of its businesses and loading progress, for example.

**2. Match between system and real world**
> **1:** Yelp does a great job of connecting with the user by using jargon that is simple to comprehend and commonly used by its userbase. Since the website is heavily dependent on user contribution, the reviews are not filled with overcomplicated words and is created specially for other Yelp users. The terminology used must be easily digestible by the everyday Yelp user.

**3. User control and freedom**
> **2:** Yelp does not have an undo feature in its search feature. Yelp also lacks a "clear" option for its search filters. It is not clear how to undo filters that were chosen by mistake. Refining choices in general could use more improvement. Yelp does a good job of allowing users to search by a map, which gives the user more freedom in their searches. Again, though, there is no way to undo the map if the user accidentally zooms away/too far from their point of interest.

**4. Consistency and standards**
> **2:** Yelp is very consistent with how it defines its features and labels. This way, it is easy for users to navigate through different parts of the site. I think Yelp does an exceptional job of keeping its terminology consistent throughout. Yelp also offers auto-fill suggestions if the user is unsure if the phrase means the same thing as what Yelp recognizes. Yelp also utilizes the same symbols for respective features throughout the site to maintain visual consistency. The website and app seem to prioritize different features, though. The website seems to prioritize the social aspect of Yelp with the "Recent Activity" on the splash page, while the mobile does not provide easy access to "Recent Activity." Instead, the mobile app provides an entire section for "Deliveries," which is not emphasized at all on the website.

**5. Error prevention**
> **1:** Yelp displays error pop-up messages when appropriate. One example of an error is if the user tries to search by "Current Location" but Yelp does not have access to the user's location. This prompts a pop-up that tells the user that the app does not have access to their location. Another good error prevention mechanism Yelp has is if the user makes a typo in the searh bar, Yelp will override the user's search entry and display results for what they think the user meant to type. There is still a "search instead for \_\_:" option if the user did actually mean to search what they typed. Yelp also prompts for confirmation in several instances, like if the user tries to delete a drafted review. 

**6. Recognition rather than recall**
> **1:** Yelp displays recently viewed businesses to its users, which makes it easy for users to remember what businesses they were just looking at. Yelp also utilizes icons that make logical sense so that users do not need to always depend on reading the section headers but rather rely on imagery. The five-star ranking system with different coloring and fill based on reviews is also easy for users to comprehend and interpret.

**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**
> **2:** Yelp is not that flexible in its search capabilities. Yelp does not allow search in multiple cities unless the user toggles the map. This means the user has to start many new searches to accomplish a simple goal of finding a partiular business. The feature toggling is useful, though, because it gives users more flexibility over the results they are presented. Another issue is that it is not intuitive for how to edit a collection (ex: delete an extraneous entry).

**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**
> **2:** Yelp recently underwent a redesign where it embraced a more minimalist design. There are less distracting lines and blocks, which make accessing relevant information easier and more efficient. Search results still display sample reviews, however, which I think is too many words for the user to comprehend, so I hypothesize that the user does not even read the sample review displayed on the search landing page. There are also too many advertisements, in my opinion.

**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
> **1:** Yelp displays constructive error messages for the user when they make an error. For example, when the user's location is not accessible, Yelp provides useful instructions for how the user can overcome this issue. Yelp also provides alternative search results if it is unable to comprehend what the user is trying to access. For example, if the user enters a location that Yelp does not recognize, it provides dozens of other locations that the user that might be useful to the user instead. Also, if a user is trying to find a particular business, Yelp will provide similar results for the user.

**10. Help and documentation**
> **3:** Yelp does not have an easily accessible "Help" or "FAQs" section. Only when the user makes an explicit error are they able to find concrete steps on how to correct the issue at hand. Although the site is relatively easy to navigate, it is very difficult to find help if the user needs it. At the very bottom of Yelp's website, there is a "Support" hyperlink that directs users to their "Support Center." This section is difficult to locate, and I could not even find it upon first look. On the mobile app, however, it is significantly easier to find the "Support Center."
